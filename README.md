## Learning Experience
For this project I've incorporated new technology I never used before. After getting started on this project I was introduced to Gulp and Sass. Gulp was tricky to get into at first but I picked up on Sass rather quickly. I like making variables for colors as opposed to trying to remember the hex codes.

Extracting information from other websites with Ajax was rather tricky but after a lot of trial and error I was able to make a functional news grid. I would love to learn more about Ajax because I have ideas for a personal project.
